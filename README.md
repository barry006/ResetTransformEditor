This script is a Unity EditorWindow script that allows you to reset the position, rotation, and scale of selected GameObjects or their children, either individually or recursively, with a custom keyboard shortcut. It is placed under the "Tools" menu in Unity's Editor and provides an interface for assigning the shortcut key.
